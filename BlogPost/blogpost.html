        <h1>Georgian Asset Declarations</h1>
        <a href="http://transparency.ge/en">Transparency International Georgia</a> created a database consisting of all information contained in  <em>Asset Declarations by Georgian Public Officials</em>. These are available in PDF format from <a href='https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/'>https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/</a>. An example of such of an Asset Declaration is <a href='https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/declaration?id=44171'>one by Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>. 
        
        In this blogpost we report on the content and the amount of information that is available in the database of Asset Declarations. 
        The database is freely available upon request from  <a href="http://transparency.ge/en">TI Georgia</a>.

        <h2>From data about separate  individuals to data about groups</h2>
        The format and the manner in which the data is presented at the Government website is <em>person-centric</em>: we can view the answers to all questions of one person together in one file. That is convenient if we are interested in that one person, but less if we want to compare persons. For that reason we collected all information from the Asset Declarations and grouped it per question.
        
        <h4>Turning the data 90 degrees</h4>
        Originally we had 11 thousand files each containing  data about <strong>one person </strong> for 11 different questions. Now we have 11 files containing data of <strong>all persons</strong>:  one spreadsheet for each question. 
        This makes group analysis possible. As an example, consider the question
        
        
        <blockquote>What is the ratio of man and women working in each ministery?</blockquote>
        We can answer that by taking all Asset Declarations filed in one year, group them by Ministery, and count how many of them are by Males and how many by Females.
        If we order the ministeries by the percentages of females working there we get the following figure. (<a href='https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1a2Y1DDtn2NQBwV9CGaMsXV_YIc3Y1TDsqOTZCZ8#chartnew:id=5'>Click here for larger figure</a>)

        The only ministry in which the majority is female (Ministry of Culture and Monument Protection of Georgia) is quite small: 9 females and 8 males. 
        The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has the smallest percentage of women working there and by far the largest number of people (946 males and 62 females).
        Full data (also with absolute numbers) is available in this <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1a2Y1DDtn2NQBwV9CGaMsXV_YIc3Y1TDsqOTZCZ8#rows:id=1">Google Fusion Table</a>
        
        <h2>Description of the dataset</h2>
        We know describe the dataset. It is available at <a href=''>data.transparancy.ge/AssetDeclarations</a>
        
        <h3>Size of the data</h3>
        Late November 2013 we could collect 11.125 Asset Declarations (AD's), which were submitted by 5.182 different people.  We found a maximum of 6 AD's submitted by one person. One of these was Tariel Fanchulidze. 
        
        Each Asset Declaration consists of information about the person filing the declaration plus answers in table format to 11 questions. The total number of rows we collected for each question is given in the following table:

        <h3>Schema  of our data base</h3>
        The following table lists the schema for each spreadsheet corresponding to a question.
        Note that the number of columns in the spreadsheet is often larger than the number of columns in the PDF's. This is because we separate information like <em>Name</em> into two columns <em>First Name, Last Name</em>. We also separate texts like <em>10000.00 GEL</em> or <em>800 m<sup>2</sup></em> into two columns.
        
        Each  line in each spreadsheet  also contains the unique number of the Asset Declaration it came from (here called "AssetDeclarationID").
        
        Next to the tables listed here our database contains two more spreadsheets.
        <ol>	<li>ADheader contains the information of the person who filed the declaration. In the following format
